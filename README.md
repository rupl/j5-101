## Hardware

These files require specific hardware to function. Until I have a proper README [read my notes](https://chrisruppel.com/blog/arduino-johnny-five-neopixel/) about the setup.

* Arduino Uno R3
* AdaFruit NeoPixel 12-LED ring
* AdaFruit NeoPixel 8x8 NeoMatrix
* AdaFruit NeoPixel 1x8 Stick
* Standard breadboard + wires
